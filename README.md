# PDFix SDK
A multi-platform PDF Library SDK.

## Description

Our PDF library analyses the key components of the PDF and make it easily available for you. With the ability to sign PDF's with both eSignatures and Digital Signatures we have your digital transactions covered.

We turn your simple PDF into a fully responsive document with semantic content and logical reading order built for you. You can search texts, you can save all images, you can export table values into your database or you can use exported elements for conversions – to HTML, JSON, Word, Excel, etc.

PDF form filling using AcroForm is an important part of many workflows. It allows data entry directly on print ready media with ability to import, export, submit or email data for further processing.

Try our autotag feature that recognises all important structures in your documents like tables, lists, reading order.
